# Problem Set 1 Submissions

- **problem_set_1_abloch.ipynb** contains the python notebook of my submission
- **problem_set_1_abloch_output.html** shows the output of an execution of the notebook
- **extra_assignment_1_abloch.py** contains the code of the extra assignment

The performance of the LogisticRegression classifier is really bad. The ROC shows that the classifier is as good as a random classifier. There are several things I'd try to improve the performance:
- Select the features in a TF-IDF-manner (but that's not what was asked)
- Use all of the data
- Use a more complex classifier
