# Problem Set 1 Submissions

The performance of the LogisticRegression classifier is really bad. The ROC shows that the classifier is as good as a random classifier. There are several things I'd try to improve the performance:
- Select the features in a TF-IDF-manner (but that's not what was asked)
- Use all of the data
- Use a more complex classifier
