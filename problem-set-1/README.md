## Comments about Solutions
The performance of the LogisticRegression classifier is really bad. The ROC shows that the classifier is as good as a random classifier. There are several things I'd try to improve the classification performance:
- select the features in a TF-IDF-manner (but that's not what was asked)
- use all of the data
- use a more complex classifier
