# Problem Set 2 Submissions

## Description of Files
- **problem_set_2_abloch.ipynb** contains the python notebook of my submission
- **problem_set_2_abloch.pdf** shows the output of an execution of the notebook
- **data_creation_and_loader.py** does all the preprocessing of the data and provides featurized datasets. More information about how to get the preprocessed datasets is in the data folder.

Note that my solution solves exercises 1 and 5 together, as the exercises were very related and it makes sense to compare the models on teh same plots.
