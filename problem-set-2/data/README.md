# Where to get the preprocessed data

You may download the preprocessed from Dropbox: 

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/79zys6zee163ivb/AADfzyddbgZKLVtV_rsCUxDWa?dl=0

Note that the location only contains the processed dataset (and not the original cases datasets).

# Doing the preprocessing yourself

If you want to repeat the preprocessing yourself, you have to copy the original dataset (cases zip file and metadata) into this directory and run the create_datasets() function.
